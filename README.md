Business statistics! What can I say, I love this topic, it has been my great companion for more than a decade of my professional career.  I have used a lot Statistics before, from normal data and non-normal data, from define the hypothesis testing until the P-value intepretation, I got this under cover.  However, this is my first time doing it inside Python, and it is fun! It feels like seeing an old friend with an upgrading lifestyle.  What I analyzed is I have helped an online newspape company, newly established and improved website, and they wanted to know whether the new website is able to attract the new and maintain the current subscriber.  By using a/b testing, hypothesis test, data visualization and statistical inference, I am helping the company to improve and strategize a new business strategy on their business.
